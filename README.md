For most people, going shopping can be a long, tedious process. Itâ€™s a fact of life that time is precious and consumer's who go about their day-to-day shopping would value convenient and time-saving solutions to their shopping experience.

Rather than waiting on long lines of queues to make money transactions and complete a shopping experience, a consumer can complete the entire process of familiarizing and buying products in the store without having to wait for attention from the store's personnel. 

The self service kiosk program aims to reduce transaction time, improve customer service, and providing a personalized shopping experience.

## Shopping Experience

With Deen's Store self service kiosk, users can start their shopping experience by inputting their name, upon which a welcome message is displayed followed by a listing of the items currently available in the store, with the prices of each item also on display. The user goes through the list of items available to determine what items they will like to purchase and can proceed to select the items. 

With each item selection, the user is also required to state the quantity they wish to purchase for each item. Users also get a request to continue or discontinue shopping after each item selection. If they wish to continue, they are asked to add other items they wish to purchase and if they wish to checkout, the cost of all the items selected will be calculated and a bill summary will be printed to the terminal.
