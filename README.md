For most people, going shopping can be a long, tedious process. Itâ€™s a fact of life that time is precious and consumer's who go about their day-to-day shopping would value convenient and time-saving solutions to their shopping experience.

Rather than waiting on long lines of queues to make money transactions and complete a shopping experience, a consumer can complete the entire process of familiarizing and buying products in the store without having to wait for attention from the store's personnel. 

The self service kiosk program aims to reduce transaction time, improve customer service, and providing a personalized shopping experience.
